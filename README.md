# simplified chess
Pichu, is a  simplified version of Chess. Here we write a Python program that plays Pichu well. 
We use the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta search and a suitable heuristic evaluation function. The program accepts a command line argument
that gives the current state of the board as a string of 64 characters as below.
```
./pichu.py w RNBQKBNRPPPPPPPP................................pppppppprnbqkbnr 10
